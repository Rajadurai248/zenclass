  * It's like waiting in line at a store where only one person can be served at a time. Everything on the web page loads one after another, like waiting for each person to finish before the next one can be helped.

  *It's like having multiple cashiers at the store, so everyone can be served at once. Instead of waiting for one thing to finish, everything loads together, making it much faster.
  *With HTTP/2, you don't have to repeat yourself so much. It's like using shortcuts to save time and get things done faster.
